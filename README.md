# CompoundDb providing compound annotations from HMDB

This package provides compound annotations from [HMDB](http://www.hmdb.ca) that
can be used with the [PeakABro](https://github.com/stanstrup/PeakABro)
R-package.

This package was created from the metabolite structure file (in SDF format) from
HMDB version 4.0 using functions from `PeakABro`.
